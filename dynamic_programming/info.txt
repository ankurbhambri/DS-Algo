Two types of Dynamic Programming  - 1. Top Down Approach 2. Bottom-Up Approach

1. Top Down Approach (Memoization is based on recursion) - Breaking big problem into small problems and simultaneously lookup into dp.
2. Bottom-up Approach (Tabulation is based on iterative) -  Moving from small to large value.
