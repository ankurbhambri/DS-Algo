Steps to Check if a Graph is Eulerian

Check Connectivity:
For an undirected graph, use a graph traversal method (DFS or BFS) to ensure all vertices with at least one edge are part of a single connected component.
For a directed graph, ensure that for every vertex, the total number of incoming edges equals the total number of outgoing edges.

Check Degree of Vertices:
For each vertex in the graph, count the degree (number of edges connected to it).

For an undirected graph:
- If all vertices have even degrees, it's Eulerian (has an Eulerian Circuit).
- If exactly two vertices have odd degrees, it has an Eulerian Path.
- Otherwise, itâ€™s not Eulerian.

For a directed graph:
- If in-degree = out-degree for every vertex, it has an Eulerian Circuit.
- If exactly two vertices have mismatched in-degree and out-degree (one has in-degree - out-degree = 1, and the other has out-degree - in-degree = 1), it has an Eulerian Path.

Steps to Check if a Directed Graph is Eulerian

Check Strong Connectivity:
A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from any vertex to every other vertex. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or any similar algorithm to verify this.
If the graph is not strongly connected, it is not Eulerian.

Check Degree Conditions:
For an Eulerian Circuit:
- In-degree = Out-degree for all vertices.

For an Eulerian Path:
- Exactly one vertex should have out-degree - in-degree = 1 (starting point of the path).
- Exactly one vertex should have in-degree - out-degree = 1 (ending point of the path).
- All other vertices should have in-degree = out-degree.
