"""
    Shortest path algorithm works may work in negative weights or may not
It runs only one iterations - o(n^2) best and worst o(n^3)

TC:
- O((V + E) log V) - E is the number of edges, V is the number of vertices using priority queue aka Min Heap
- O(E log V) for the priority queue operations
- O(V) for the initialization of the distances

TC worst case is O(n^2) in case of n vertices processed and n vertex relaxed
