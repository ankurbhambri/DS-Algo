You are given a graph (usually a 2D grid, but conceptually any graph):

Nodes = cells or locations

Edges = possible movements (up/down/left/right)

Lava sources start spreading simultaneously

Lava spreads one step per time unit

A person also moves one step per time unit

The person cannot enter a node at the same time or after lava arrives
