# System Design Questions
- Ad Click Aggregator (More common for Infra)
- Memcache (1% of the time, E4 will be asked this like an unfortunate candidate did a few days ago...)
- Top K Heavy Hitters (More common for Infra)
- Botnets (And 5% of the time, it's an actual webcrawler. More common for Infra)
- Online Chess (Not frequently asked but yikes, it's a hard one)
- Design Coding Contest Platform on Leetcode or something similar (This is an important distinction. It's ALWAYS asked in a contest setting, it's never just Leetcode. Plus, Meta will even say - it's Leetcode-esque, so it could be Hackerrank or OnlineJudge)
- Design FB Privacy Settings (More common for Infra)
- Design FB Live
- Design DropBox
- Design Newsfeed
- Design Eventbrite, a ticket-selling platform.
