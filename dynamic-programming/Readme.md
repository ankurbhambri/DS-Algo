# Dynamic Programming approaches

1. Top Down Approach (``Memoization`` is based on recursion) - Breaking big problem into small problems and simultaneously lookup into dp.
2. Bottom-up Approach (``Tabulation`` is based on iterative) -  Moving from small to large value.
3. ``Optimization`` Approach where we optimize the space complexity, while utilizing the Tabulation approach.

## Important Points:

- Try to represent the problem in terms of index.
- Do all possible ways on that index all to the problem statement.
- Sum all ways, count of all ways, min of all ways
- whenever there is index there must be possibilty of space optimization.
